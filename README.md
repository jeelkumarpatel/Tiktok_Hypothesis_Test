# Hypothesis_Testing Overview:  
Conducted a hypothesis test to analyse the relationship between verified_status and view_count for Titok review classification model.  

ùêª0: There is no difference in number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and TikTok videos posted by unverified accounts (any observed difference in the sample data is due to chance or sampling variability).  

ùêªùê¥: There is a difference in number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and TikTok videos posted by unverified accounts (any observed difference in the sample data is due to an actual difference in the corresponding population means).  

The p-value is extremely small (much smaller than the significance level of 5%), I rejected the null hypothesis.  

Key insights: The analysis shows that there is a statistically significant difference in the average view counts between videos from verified accounts and videos from unverified accounts. This suggests there might be fundamental behavioral differences between these two groups of accounts.
